## Prerequisites

As the dev tools are dependent on `npm`, also make sure that you have a [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installation on your machine (the latest the better)!

## Installation

To install the extension dependencies, simply run:
```
npm install
```

## Running the app in development

To run the app locally, simply run:
```
npm run dev
```
